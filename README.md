# weShare Community Tasking App

Our team have seen many instances where NUS hostel residents struggle to juggle between work and hostel lives. We believe that residents can gather strength from the community to get errands done and quick hostel supplies. weShare seeks to bridge the gap between residents in need to other available residents.

Built with the Firebase, Angular and Node (FAN) tech stack, weShare offers a platform for requests and a targeted hostel marketplace. It also includes a real-time chat and push notifications to facilitate smoother transactions. With a focus on responsive web design, we have ensured that our web-app is compatible across laptops, tablets and even mobile. This project is currently hosted at https://splashbros-126a0.web.app/.

## How are we different from similar platforms?
Beyond the Carousell marketplace
- Users are specific to their hostel community so products that are traded are more relevant and targeted to the residentsâ€™ needs.
- Not only do we offer goods transactions, but we also allow residents to provide and get services that they need.
- This platforms further promotes sharing and helping of one another in return for non-monetary incentives

Beyond chat apps like Telegram/WhatsApp
- Chats on our platform are more directed for the particular transaction rather than a general platform for texting
- We directly link you up to each user for each request or listing 
- You can start a chat with anyone in the community without having to know their phone number

Beyond other general community tasking platform
- Our app is focused on fulfilling the needs of hostel residents
- Even beyond the features mentioned above, there are many other features that can further ease hostel life
- This includes live tracking of dining hall crowd for residents to choose when to consume dinner (especially useful for this COVID situation)
- Training calendar for CCAs for residents to track their busy schedules
